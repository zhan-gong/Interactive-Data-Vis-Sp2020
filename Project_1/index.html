      <h1>Project 1</h1>
      <h2>Corona Virus in Hubei Province, China</h2>
      <p>My project is related to the outbreak of coronavirus that happened in Wuhan, China. As of February 23rd, 77,048 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in China. In Wuhan , where the epidemic might have begun (which is also my hometown), more than 46,607 cases have been confirmed. The Chinese authorities have closed off Wuhan since January 23rd; in the following week, other cities in Hubei also went into lockdown to control the virusâ€™ spread. </p>
      <p>The chart below is showing the population in each city</p>

    <p>I'm still looking fot the json file but I'm not sure if I can find it. I guess I'll try my best to create a json file by myself.</p>
