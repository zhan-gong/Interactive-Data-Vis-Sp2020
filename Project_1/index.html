      <h1>Final Project</h1>
      <h2>The Distance that Matters: </h3>
      <h3>Spread of the Coronavirus Outbreak in Hubei Cities, China</h2>

    <p1>This final project examines the relationship between the original epicenter of coronavirus, Wuhan, and its nearby cities. Wuhan is located in Hubei Province, which is part of the Central China region. Besides Wuhan, there are 16 cities in Hubei. Together, Hubei is home to 60 million population. As of February 23rd, 2020, more than 46,607 COVID-19 cases were confirmed in Wuhan. The Chinese authorities closed off Wuhan on January 23rd; in the following week, other cities in Hubei Province also went into lockdown to control the spread of the virus. Among these cities, it is reasonable to assume that the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in one city may be directly related to its proximity to Wuhan. Cities near Wuhan may have a higher exposure to the virus than cities further away, thus having a higher number of people infected. In this project, I will visualize the association between the geographic distance from each city in Hubei province to Wuhan and its total confirmed cases as of February 23rd.</p>
